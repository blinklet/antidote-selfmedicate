# antidote-selfmedicate

This is where you can set up a development environment for antidote curriculum. If you want to create new lessons
or add to existing ones, this is what you will need to be able to preview your changes locally before opening a Pull Request.

It is **highly recommended** that you start by reading [the docs](https://antidoteproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building/local.html).
